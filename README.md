# AFSFM
# Overview
This code is designed to run on MATLAB 2020b. It includes our experiment results and scripts for performing the experiments. The experiments are divided into three time points: baseline, 12-month, and 24-month, corresponding to three separate packages
1. **1.baseline**
2. **2.12-m**
3. **3.24-m**

## Running the Code
If you want to obtain the experimental results for the **baseline** data, you need to add the **`1.baseline`** folder to your MATLAB path. After adding the folder to the path, you can run the experiments using the provided script files.

The following three script files are included for running the corresponding binary classification experiments:
1. **run1_PDvsNC.m – PD vs NC binary classification**
2. **run2_SWvsNC.m – SW vs NC binary classification**
3. **run3_PDvsSW.m – PD vs SW binary classification**

Running these scripts will generate the respective results for each binary classification task.
